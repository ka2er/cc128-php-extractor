cc128-php-extractor is a PHP program to make graphics from your current cost cc128 device.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Actually there is 2 parts :
- PHP extractor (ENVI => PHP => Sqlite)
- Python upload (Sqlite => Python => Google Power Meter)

In a future release PHP extractor will be replaced with a python one.


The program use the 2-hour consumption average so it needs to be pluged all the 30 days 
to don't loose any data.


PHP extractor usage :

- configure serial port into cc128.php
- hold down OK and down buttons on the cc128 (current cost) untill led is flashing
- run in a console 
	$ php cc128.php
- the program is acquiring new data and store them
- you should now have an cc128.db sqllite file
- the db file is used to generated a javascript file holding all the plots
- open index.html in your browser and review your power consumption


to refresh data :
- use the same procedure (only new data will be added)


Python upload usage :
- configure authToken and variable path in config
- run in a console
	$ python -f full_path_to_config_file path_to_sqlite_file
